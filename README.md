# landing-page-on-client-s-order
A landing page made from a client order. The project consisted of reworking the template in HTML5 , CSS3 and JS. I realized the project as a Freelancer Front-End Developer.
In the project, I was responsible for:
# Arranging elements using CSS3.
# Animation of the page opening using JavaScript.
# Adding images in HTML5 and placing them using CSS3

# WARNING!

# CODE WRITTEN BY ME IN CSS3 FILES IS COMMENTED WITH MY NAME. I DO NOT ALLOW DOWNLOADING ANY FILES OR MODIFYING THE CODE!
